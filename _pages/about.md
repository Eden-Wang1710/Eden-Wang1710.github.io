Hi, I'm Wang Zixuan (王子瑄). I'm now a final-year Computer Science undergraduate at City University of Hong Kong.

My research interests lie in Large Language Models, especially the interpretability, safety, reliability and domain-specific application. 

I use blogs to record my learning: [Eden's machine learning notebooks](https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1756621321792831489)
